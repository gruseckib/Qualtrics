## Just another repo of Qualtrics scripts

I've been a brand administrator for awhile with Qualtrics and have needed faster, more efficient ways of managing the brand.  I had some issues using the actual Qualtrics documentation as it's often structured to work with Mac &/o Linux, hopefully a fellow Windows using Brand Administrator finds this useful!
